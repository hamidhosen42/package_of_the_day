  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/audios/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/banner/
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/images/rflutter_alert/
    - assets/images/staggered_grid_view/
    - assets/images/audioplayer/
    - assets/images/onboarding/
    - assets/images/intro_slider/
    - assets/images/parallax_animation/
    - assets/images/foods/
    - assets/images/background/
    - assets/videos/
    - assets/images/introduction_screen/
    - assets/images/placeholder/

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NeumorphicIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NeumorphicIcons.ttf

    - family: Canterbury
      fonts:
